## The Call to Prayer

As St. Thérèse of Lisieux reminds us, "Prayer is a surge of the heart; it is a simple look turned toward heaven." These resources are designed to help you cultivate that simple, loving gaze toward God in your daily life.

From morning prayers to evening examens, from novenas for special intentions to meditations on the mysteries of the Rosary, this collection supports Catholics at every stage of their spiritual journey.
