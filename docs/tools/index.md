## Technology in Service of Faith

Following the example of St. Isidore of Seville, who used the technology of his time (the codex) to preserve and share knowledge, these modern tools harness digital technology to spread the Gospel and support Catholic life.

From apps that help you pray the Rosary to GitHub repositories containing liturgical calendar APIs, technology becomes a means of evangelization and community building in the 21st century.
